## iOS

No breaking changes :relieved:

## Android

[v5 introduces a change](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-share/issues/936) to remove the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission from being automatically added to implementing apps.

### Removal of WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission request

`base64` file sharing requires the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to be included in the AndroidManifest.xml file. As `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is seen as a [dangerous](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) permission, it is now the responsibility of the implementing app to add this permission to their own AndroidManifest.xml file.

To do this, add:

```xml
<!-- required for react-native-share base64 sharing -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

to your application's `AndroidManifest.xml` file as per the example project.
